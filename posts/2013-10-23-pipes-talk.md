title: "September pipes talk"
---

Back in September I presented a talk at the London Haskell User Group on the 4th
version of the [pipes](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes) library.
Unfortunatuly, we had a problem with the microphone and had to fall back to the
built-in microphone on the camera for audio. However, Derek has done a fantastic
job piecing this all together, and I'm happy to announce that my talk is now on
YouTube:

Slides can be found at [http://ocharles.org.uk/talks/2013-09-18-pipes.pdf](http://ocharles.org.uk/talks/2013-09-18-pipes.pdf).
This is the first talk I've ever given, and I'd love to hear feedback on how I
can improve in the future.

Enjoy!
