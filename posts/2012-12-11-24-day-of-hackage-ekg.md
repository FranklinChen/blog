title: "24 Days of Hackage: EKG"
---

If you have a long running application, there is a high chance that sooner or later,
it's going to misbehave. Load changes, usage patterns increase, or perhaps just
running for long periods of time is something your application doesn't deal
well with. In times like this you need to monitor your application so you can
get on with reproducing - and ultimately solving - the problem.

Johan Tibell's [`EKG`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ekg) package is one
answer. EKG provides you with a HTTP server that runs alongside your
application, allowing you to view real time statistics. Simply by enabling EKG,
which is only a handful of lines in the IO monad, you get access to a lot of
juicy GHC details.

Reusing the example of [helping Santa](/posts/2012-12-03-postgresql-simple.html)
from the `postgresql-simple` article, lets add some monitoring:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = forkServer "localhost" 8000 >> santaNotifier
```

Well, that wasn't hard! Now if we connect to `http://localhost:8000/` while the
server is running, we're present with something a little like this:

![The EKG dashboard](/img/ekg.png)

The default dashboard shows you a graph of resident memory usage, allocation
rate and productivity, but you can make any statistic you want become a graph by
simply clicking on the little graph icons.

But EKG doesn't stop there - it also provides you with the ability to create
your own counters, gauges, and labels. This means that you now have the ability
to track application specific metrics, and have them graphed in real time!
Perhaps we want to have a counter for every time we notify Santa:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  ekg <- forkServer "localhost" 8000
  getCounter "notifications" ekg >>= santaNotifier

santaNotifier c counter = listen >> loop
  where
    listen = query c "LISTEN presents"
    loop = forever $
      getNotification c >>= notifySanta . notificationData >> inc counter
```

Your also not constrained to the HTML display that EKG provides you with - all
of the URLs endpoints take the Accept header, allowing you to vary the content
type, with choices of JSON and plain text currently.

EKG takes very little time to setup, but the gains are enormous, especially once
you have started graphing your own metrics. Johan has
[blogged about EKG](http://blog.johantibell.com/2011/12/remotely-monitor-any-haskell.html)
before, so be sure to check that out too.

EKG isn't the only solution, of course - you still have the option of tools like
statsd or rolling your own custom monitoring code. But sometimes you just need
some numbers *now*. STAT!
