title: "24 Days of Hackage"
---

Today we won't look at any new libraries but instead would just like to express
a heart felt thank you to everyone who has followed and encouraged me throughout
this blog series. It's the first time I've tried to do a programming advent
calendar, and while it's been a stressful ride, I couldn't be happier with the
end result.

I just wanted to share a couple of select quotes that have really lifted my
spirit and made this work all the more worthwhile - though it'd be hard to
enumerate them all!

My original goal was to spread just a little bit of knowledge and surprise
someone; so I think I've pulled that off!

In the new year, I'm considering doing a series of semi-live-coding videos, and
if you're interested in this feel free to email me at ollie@ocharles.org.uk with
ideas - I'm mostly looking at projects that could be created in about 4 hours
(at most).

Anyway, thanks for all your comments, and have a very Haskell Chirstmas!
