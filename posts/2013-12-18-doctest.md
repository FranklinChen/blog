title: "24 Days of Hackage: doctest"
---

Testing and documentation. Two words that will make even the most hardened
programmers shudder. Unfortunately, they are ultimately two of the most
important aspects of programming - especially if you want your work to succeed
in the wild. Even if you practice test-driven development religiously, you still
can't rule out writing documentation. If only there was a method to combine the
two...

[Simon Hengel's](http://typeful.net)
[`doctest`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/doctest) library is one solution
that can ease this pain. Modelled off the
[`doctest`](http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html) library for Python,
`doctest` embeds tests inside the documentation of modules. The idea is: if
testing requires code to be tested and an expected result, then we can treat
this as an expected interaction at a REPL. So the work required by the
programmer is to enter the input and output of a REPL session. `doctest` then
parses the documentation and runs the code, checking that your expectation
matches reality. If so, then it naturally follows that your documentation is
consistent with what the library does.

`doctest` for Haskell works using [Haddock's](http://haskell.org/haddock)
documentation strings. For example, we can easily check that a `square` function
does indeed square its input:

```haskell
{-| Given an integer, 'square' returns the same number squared:

>>> square 5
25
-}
square :: Int -> Int
square x = x * x
```

To run this, we have two options. One is to simply use the `doctest` executable:

```
> doctest 2013-12-18-square.hs
Examples: 1  Tried: 1  Errors: 0  Failures: 0
```

However, in bigger projects you'll want to integrate doctests into your
[Cabal](http://haskell.org/cabal) file. This means that running `cabal test`
will also run doctests, which makes it harder to forget to run them. To do this,
we just have to build a little executable that calls the `doctest` function:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = doctest [ "2013-12-17-square.hs" ]
```

The output of this is the same, but we can now easily integrate this as a
test-suite in a Cabal file.

So far we've only see a simple test of a pure function, but `doctest` can go a
lot further. For example, we might have a function that requires a callback.
In a GHCI session, we might write this callback in a let binding, and we can do
the same in doctest. The function we are testing will work in the IO monad, and
the expected behaviour is to print to standard output. This is naturally
expressed in `doctest` - we just write out what we'd expect to see in GHCI:

```haskell
{-|
>>> :{
      let callback name = do
            putStrLn $ "Hello. Yes, this is " ++ name
>>> :}

>>> printer "Dog" callback
Dog says:
Hello. Yes, this is Dog
-}
printer :: String -> (String -> IO ()) -> IO ()
printer name callBack = do
  putStrLn $ name ++ " says:"
```

Observant readers will not that this isn't quite what it claims - and `doctest`
notices that too:

```
### Failure in 2013-12-18-print.hs:9: expression `printer "Dog" callback'
expected: Dog says:
          Hello. Yes, this is Dog
 but got: Dog says:
```

Whoops, looks like we forgot to actually call the callback! If we fix that, we
get a happy result from `doctest` once again.

If you're a library author, I highly recommend you give `doctest` ago - it's
usage really is a net win. You get more guarantees that your library is doing
what is expected of it, and you get even more back if you encourage your users
to help write documentation. By writing examples for you, they'll also be
writing test cases - and probably test cases for the things they care about too.
