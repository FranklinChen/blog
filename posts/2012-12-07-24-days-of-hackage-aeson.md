title: "24 Days of Hackage: aeson"
---

Many of today's programmers would likely consider the ability to parse JSON
fairly essential when choosing a programming language. With tools like CouchDB,
not to mention a large proportion of web services offering JSON (and sometimes
*only* JSON), JSON is unavoidable. Fret not, Haskell is perfectly capable of
this task, and in today's post we will look at
[Bryan O'Sullivan](http://www.serpentine.com/blog/)'s aeson library.

[Aeson](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson) is a small library,
offering not much in way of an API - something I regard as a
feature. Essentially, `aeson` consists of a parser, and a pair of To/From JSON
classes to convert between JSON and richer Haskell structures.

These type classes are probably where most people will spend time programming
with `aeson`, so let's have a look at these first. The `ToJSON` type class
allows you to convert any Haskell value into JSON. `Aeson` comes with some
batteries included, allowing you to convert text, numbers, lists, dates, and
more. The `FromJSON` type class acts in the opposite direction, mapping a JSON
AST into Haskell values. Again, there are many instances out of the box.

Careful readers will have noticed that there are two separate type classes here,
rather than one - why is that? After all, wouldn't the API be simpler if we only
had one type class with both `toJSON` *and* `parseJSON`? On the one hand, yes,
but by having two classes, we are able to be a lot more flexible. Perhaps our
Haskell values contain internal identifiers in their construction, something we
don't want to expose in our JSON web service, so it would be impossible to
implement `parseJSON`. By splitting the type classes, this is now no longer a
problem.

I think it's time for an example!

```haskell
data Cheese = Cheese { cheeseMaturity :: Maturity
                     , cheeseWeight :: Double
                     -- etc
                     }

data Maturity = Strong | Mild

instance ToJSON Maturity where
  toJSON Strong = String "strong"
  toJSON Mild   = String "mild"

instance FromJSON Maturity where
  parseJSON (String "strong") = pure Strong
  parseJSON (String "mild")   = pure Mild
  parseJSON _                 = fail "Unknown cheese strength!"

instance ToJSON Cheese where
  toJSON Cheese{..} = object [ "maturity" .= cheeseMaturity
                             , "weight" .= cheeseWeight
                             ]

instance FromJSON Cheese where
  parseJSON (Object o) = Cheese <$> o .: "maturity"
                                <*> o .: "weight"
  parseJSON _ = fail "Failed to parse cheese!"
```

As you can see, `aeson` provides some nice combinators for implementing `toJSON`
- `object` and `.=` combine to provide an expressive readable EDSL for building
up JSON structures. As I'm stressing throughout this series, combinators let us
build up complexity from small building blocks. Combinators, combinators,
combinators!

`FromJSON` also benefits from a rich parser, and this time you don't have to
learn anything new! All parsing is done in the `Parser` `Monad`, which is also
an `Applicative` functor, which we take advantage to construct `Cheese`!

`Parser` provides even more than that though - there is also an `Alternative`
instance so you can try parsing multiple representations - which comes in really
handy when dealing with multiple versions of a web service!

`Aeson` can also be used to work directly with the AST too , you don't have to
write `To`/`FromJSON` instances if you don't want. The AST is simple, in fact
the Value data type is just the sum of string, array, object, number and null
constructors. [Chris Done](http://chrisdone.com/) has written some
[great documentation](http://chrisdone.com/aeson/dist/doc/html/aeson/Data-Aeson.html)
on why you might want to do this. Hopefully soon `aeson` will have a new release
and this will be on Hackage for all the world to see.

So there we have it, a great API with a fast implementation and type safety - is
there anything Haskell can't do?
