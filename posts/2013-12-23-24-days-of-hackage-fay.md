title: "24 Days of Hackage: fay"
---

A few days ago, we
[looked at the `websockets`](/posts/2013-12-19-websockets.html)
library. The server side was great - lots of Haskell! However, writing the
client left a bit to be desired - we had to write JavaScript and HTML, yuck!
[Last year we saw that `blaze-html`](/posts/2012-12-22-24-days-of-hackage-blaze.html)
gives us a nice EDSL for HTML generation, but what about JavaScript? Today we're
going to look at a slightly different approach, and look at
[Fay](http://fay-lang.org).

Rather than providing a library for GHC Haskell, Fay is a Haskell-to-JavaScript
compiler - specifically allowing us to compile a subset of Haskell to
JavaScript. Of these differences, the biggest is the lack of type classes,
though many experienced Fay developers tend to feel this can be worked
around. Let's jump right in and rewrite our `websockets` client using
Fay. First, a review of the existing JavaScript code:

```javascript
var prompt = document.getElementById('prompt');
var connectionToSanta = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080/");
var messages = document.getElementById('repl');

function log(message, cls) {
    var messageNode = document.createElement("li");
    messageNode.innerHTML = message;
    messageNode.className = cls;
    repl.appendChild(messageNode);
}

connectionToSanta.onopen = function(e) {
    prompt.disabled = false;
    prompt.onkeydown = function (e) {
        if (e.keyCode == 13) {
            connectionToSanta.send(prompt.value);
            log(prompt.value, "me");
            prompt.value = "";
        }
    }
};
connectionToSanta.onmessage = function (m) {
    log(m.data, "");
}
```

There's  not a lot of JavaScript code here, but you'll see that we do exercise a
reasonable amount of the language. We're using a few variables, some functions
for callbacks, defining common functionality via a named function, and making
API calls to create WebSockets.

First, lets look at the `log` function - that looks easy enough. We need to
create a new DOM element, set a few properties on it, and then append it to
another document element. Fay doesn't come with functions to do this directly,
but it does expose a *foreign function interface* that allows us to easily
translate Haskell code into JavaScript calls. To do this, we simply create a
function who's body is a call to `ffi`, and provide an associated type
signature. For `createElement`, we have:

```haskell
data Element

createElement :: String -> Fay Element
createElement = ffi "document.createElement(%1)"
```

The type signature indicates the type of the foreign function, and we use
`ffi` to describe what actual code to run. Fay will interpolate function
arguments into the JavaScript, using placeholders marked by `%1`, etc. We
operate in the Fay monad, for the same reason we do potentially real-world side
effecting work in the IO monad.

We've also introduced a `Element` type, which uses the `EmptyDataDecls`
extension to add no constructors. This means the only way to create `Element`s
is by calling out via foreign functions.

We need a more `ffi` routines to set the `innerHTML` and `className`, and
another to append one `Element` to another. We write these in much the same way:

```haskell
setInnerHTML :: Element -> String -> Fay ()
setInnerHTML = ffi "%1['innerHTML'] = %2"

setClassName :: Element -> String -> Fay ()
setClassName = ffi "%1['innerHTMl'] = %2"

appendChild :: Element -> Element -> Fay ()
appendChild = ffi "%1.appendChild(%2)"
```

Now we can write our `log` function:

```haskell
log :: Element -> String -> String -> Fay ()
log container msg cls = do
  logNode <- createElement "li"
  setInnerHTML logNode msg
  setClassName logNode cls
  container `appendChild` logNode
```

Here we simply use the `Fay` monad to sequence DOM-manipulating operations. As
before, we create a new `li` element, set the class and content, and then append
this to a log container. Because in Haskell we don't have global variables, we
have to explicitly pass in the log container - which is arguably more
maintainable code anyway!

Now that we've seen how the FFI works, we can also see how to write the first
lines of our script - we need FFI routines to select the prompt and log
container elements, and one more call to create our WebSocket:

```haskell
getElementById :: String -> Fay Element
getElementById = ffi "document.getElementById(%1)"

data WebSocket

newWebSocket :: String -> Fay WebSocket
newWebSocket = ffi "new WebSocket(%1)"
```

To create new objects the syntax is the same as creating objects in JavaScript,
and the same `ffi` call in Haskell - which is nice for consistency. We introduce
a new type for WebSockets, in order to leverage the lovely benefits of
type-safety in our Fay code.

Finally, we need to deal with callbacks. This is actually really simple and the
answer is - you guessed it - another `ffi` declaration. This time, we'll be a
little more general, and create a `ffi` binding to add an event listener in the
general case:

```haskell
class Eventable

data Event

instance Eventable WebSocket
instance Eventable Element

addEventListener :: Eventable a => a -> String -> (Event -> Fay ()) -> Fay ()
addEventListener = ffi "%1[%2] = %3"
```

Here we use the limited type class support in Fay to create a class of
`Eventable` objects - and both `Element`s and `WebSockets` can have event
listeners.

There are only a few more `ffi` bindings to go now, and then we're ready to
write the bulk of our application. I'll leave the bindings to the associated
code, and lets look at how our application looks when we put it all together:

```haskell
main :: Fay ()
main = do
  prompt <- getElementById "prompt"
  messages <- getElementById "repl"
  connectionToSanta <- newWebSocket "ws://localhost:8080"

  addEventListener connectionToSanta "onopen" $ \_ -> do
    setDisabled prompt False
    addEventListener prompt "onkeydown" $ \e -> do
      if (eventKeyCode e == 13)
        then do
          let message = elementValue prompt
          connectionToSanta `send` message
          log messages message "me"
          clearValue prompt
        else return ()

  addEventListener connectionToSanta "onmessage" $ \e -> do
    log messages (messageData e) ""
```

To use this from the HTML page, we just need to drop in:

```html
<script src="2013-12-23-fay.js" type="application/javascript"></script>
```

Once we include this, our page behaves exactly as before. Except we also get
that warm fuzzy feeling of knowing that we got to write Haskell to generate all
of this.
